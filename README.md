# Profiling

## Performance Testing with JMeter Vs. Intellij
The difference lies in their approach of optimizing the application performance. While JMeter measures an app's performance by simulating high load on an application, Intellij is used to find bottleneck within an application.

## How profiling helps identify and understand weak points in application
It helps by showing which lines of code that caused the bottleneck. From there, we can slowly analyze the code, find the root problem, and fix it using optimization.

## Is Intellij effective in analyzing and identifying bottlenecks
Intellij is quite effective in finding bottleneck within the app because it provides flame graph, which shows which part takes the longest to execute.

## Main challenges in performance testing
There are two main challenges, which are understanding the result of profiling and doing the optimization.

## Main benefits of using Intellij to do profiling
The main benefit is that the use of third party apps are no longer needed, all the tools are available in the same environment.

## Handling situation where the results of Intellij profiling isn't consistent with JMeter
So far, there are no inconsistencies so I can't answer this yet. But I'll trust Intellij more.

## Strategy in optimizing application code after analyzing result
The strategies are reducing the database calls, optimizing the data structure to save time and memory, and query optimization.

## Test results
Sorry, but I don't know how to put pictures inside a README so I put in my GDocs. Here is the link [Optimization](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y-riKym8uXXasYSKGUsyj2E1YjsWcs0UElYSU9Vz1r0/edit?usp=sharing)
